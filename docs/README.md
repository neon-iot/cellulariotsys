# Cellular IoT Technologies
#
This is a graduate course to introduce concepts of the Internet of things based on cellular communication networks. In particular, we consider Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) 3GPP standard, as an example case derived from the general 3GPP LTE standard. We pay attention to how LTE energy efficiency and congestion control techniques fit NB-IoT. In addition, special emphasis is placed on the management of uplink and downlink signals (multiple access, synchronization).
The course includes demonstrative laboratories where students will learn to characterize parameters of the physical layer with the aim to determine the Quality of Service (QoS). These laboratories include velocity and bandwidth test, coverage level, latency and power consumption. 

## Main topics
*	Motivations, OFDM synchronization models, 3GPP characteristics.
*	Narrowband IoT basics, functional layers, idle and connected mode procedures.
*	Narrowband IoT uplink and downlink synchronization.

## What you will learn
*	Main design technologies associated to IoT: user-centered or service-centered.
*	OFDM modulation characteristics as a case example of modulation suitable for service-centered IoT.
*	Functional layer model of 3GPP standard and basic characteristics.
*	Narrowband IoT layer model with emphasis on physical and medium access layers.
*	Synchronization aspects of NB-IoT.

## What you will need:
*	Basic courses in digital modulations and data networks are pre-required.
*	Also, basic knowledge of linear estimation â€“ detection techniques will be helpful.
*	Matlab is used for testing some aspects of NB-IoT.

## The material available:
*	Detail of the 3-module part of the course.
*	Docs: that contain the syllabus and the laboratories description.
*	Slides: that includes detailed classroom slides.
